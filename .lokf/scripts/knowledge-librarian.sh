# Wrapper for the scheduled knowledge-librarian loop (Karpathy rule).
#
# `.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml` invokes whatever the
# `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_CMD` repository variable points at. Set that variable to:
#
#     bash .lokf/scripts/knowledge-librarian.sh
#
# ...and set `AGENT_CLI` (repo variable or secret) to the command that runs your
# coding agent non-interactively - e.g. the GitHub Copilot CLI or an internal
# agent runner that accepts a prompt on `-p`/stdin.
#
# CONTRACT (the workflow relies on this):
#   - This script only READS the repo and WRITES files under .lokf/knowledge/
#     (the workflow diffs and commits that path only; tooling files are
#     lokf-scaffolding's domain).
#   - It MUST NOT git commit, push, or open PRs - the workflow owns that.
#   - On success it exits 0 whether or not it changed anything; the workflow
#     diffs the working tree to decide whether to open a PR.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   AGENT_CLI   command that runs the agent given a prompt via -p "<prompt>"
#

knowledge-librarian: AGENT_CLI is not set.

Set AGENT_CLI to your non-interactive agent command (e.g. a Copilot CLI or
internal runner). This wrapper hands it a prompt built from the lokf-librarian
skill; the agent is expected to edit files under .lokf/knowledge/ only.

You are the repository knowledge librarian. Follow this skill file verbatim:
  - $skill

Task (Karpathy rule - continuous small corrections, not a rewrite):
  1. Follow the skill's Scrape & build procedure: bootstrap discovery if the
     bundle has no real concepts yet, otherwise the steady-state refresh of the
     sources recorded in the bundle (concept provenance and
     .lokf/knowledge/playbooks/knowledge-sources.md).
  2. Reconcile the .lokf/ knowledge bundle with the repository: add missing
     concepts, correct stale facts (refreshing each changed concept's
     `generated` provenance, which supersedes the v0.1 `timestamp`), wire
     typed relations, and prepend dated entries to
     .lokf/knowledge/log.md - but only when the bundle content actually
     changed. If nothing changed, leave the bundle (including log.md)
     untouched; do not log administrative no-op runs.
  3. Only edit files under .lokf/knowledge/. Do NOT run git, open PRs, or touch
     any other path. Cite sources for any claim whose authority is outside the
     repository.
