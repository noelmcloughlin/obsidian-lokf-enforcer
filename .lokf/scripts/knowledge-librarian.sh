# Wrapper for the scheduled knowledge-librarian loop (Karpathy rule).
#
# `.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml` invokes this script directly - a
# fixed, reviewed path, not an arbitrary command from a repo variable. To arm the
# scheduled run, set the `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_ENABLED` repository variable to
# "true", and set `AGENT_CLI` (repo variable or secret) to the command that runs
# your coding agent non-interactively - e.g. the GitHub Copilot CLI or an internal
# agent runner that accepts a prompt on `-p`/stdin.
#
# CONTRACT (the workflow relies on this):
#   - This script only READS the repo and WRITES files under .lokf/knowledge/
#     (the workflow diffs and commits that path only; tooling files are
#     lokf-sidecar's domain).
#   - It MUST NOT git commit, push, or open PRs - the workflow owns that.
#   - On success it exits 0 whether or not it changed anything; the workflow
#     diffs the working tree to decide whether to open a PR.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   AGENT_CLI   command that runs the agent given a prompt via -p "<prompt>"

knowledge-librarian: AGENT_CLI is not set.

Set AGENT_CLI to your non-interactive agent command (e.g. a Copilot CLI or
internal runner). This wrapper hands it a prompt built from the lokf-librarian
skill; the agent is expected to edit files under .lokf/knowledge/ only.

You are the repository knowledge librarian. Follow this skill file verbatim:
  - $skill

Task (Karpathy rule - continuous small corrections, not a rewrite):
  1. Follow the skill's Scrape & build procedure: bootstrap discovery if the
     bundle has no real concepts yet, otherwise the steady-state refresh of the
     sources recorded in the bundle (concept provenance and
     .lokf/knowledge/playbooks/knowledge-sources.md).
  2. Reconcile the .lokf/ knowledge bundle with the repository: add missing
     concepts, correct stale facts (refreshing each changed concept's
     \`generated\` provenance, which supersedes the v0.1 \`timestamp\`), wire
     typed relations, and prepend dated entries to
     .lokf/knowledge/log.md - but only when the bundle content actually
     changed. If nothing changed, leave the bundle (including log.md)
     untouched; do not log administrative no-op runs.
  3. Only edit files under .lokf/knowledge/. Do NOT run git, open PRs, or touch
     any other path. Cite sources for any claim whose authority is outside the
     repository.
  4. Mark concepts you create, and claims you cannot settle from the
     repository, as \`status: draft\` (with a plain-prose "## Open questions"
     section for the latter), exactly as the skill says. End your reply with a
     short "For the curator" summary: how many concepts are drafts, which
     carry open questions, and how many are confirmed by a person.

# Security rationale (for human and automated reviewers): AGENT_CLI is trusted
# configuration, not untrusted input - a repo admin sets it in Settings (the
# operator naming their own agent command); it is never derived from repo
# contents, PR data, or model output. It is parsed into a quoted argv array and
# run directly (see below), so bash does NOT re-evaluate it as source: shell
# metacharacters (; | & $() ``) are passed as inert arguments, not executed -
# there is no eval and no `bash -c`. This step runs only in the workflow's
# read-only `refresh` job (contents: read, no persisted credentials), and the
# post-run check further fails if the agent wrote outside .lokf/knowledge/.
# That check, and the AGENT_CLI invocation itself, live inside main() below,
# called only from this file's last line: bash reads a function body in full
# before running any of it, so - unlike the top-level statements this used to
# be - nothing after the agent call can be skipped by an agent that truncates
# this script mid-run (bash otherwise just stops at whatever the file's
# current length on disk is when it gets there).
#
# Split AGENT_CLI into an argv array (whitespace word-split, no globbing) and
# invoke it as a quoted vector rather than a re-expanded string. Handles the
# usual "cmd --flags" form; quotes *inside* AGENT_CLI are not honoured - keep it
# to a plain command plus flags, or wrap richer logic in its own script.

# Defence in depth: the prompt asks the agent to edit only .lokf/knowledge/, but

# uv.lock the workflow refreshed) so the agent is held to account only for *new*
# ones. Allowed: the bundle under either of its two names - .lokf/knowledge/,
# and knowledge_bundle/ when that is the real folder and .lokf/knowledge the
# link onto it (lokf-sidecar's visible layout; git pathspecs do not traverse a
# symlink, so both must be named) - plus lokf-docent's .lokf/feedback.md.
