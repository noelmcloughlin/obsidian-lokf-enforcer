# LOKF Librarian

Maintain `.lokf/` - the host repository's knowledge captured as a [**Linked Open Knowledge Format (LOKF)**](https://lokf.nolan-nichols.com/specification/) bundle. LOKF is a **semantic profile of OKF**: the same directory of Markdown + YAML frontmatter, but every field, type, and relationship is bound to a public vocabulary (schema.org / DCAT / PROV-O), so the bundle expands losslessly to JSON/JSON-LD and RDF and is queryable with SPARQL. This skill covers the full lifecycle: **scrape -> build/maintain -> audit -> hand off for review -> keep fresh on a schedule.**

**Why this matters:** plain OKF gives knowledge *prose + structure*; typical hand-rolled ("vibe-coded") OKF setups add *tools* that only work in the repo that grew them; LOKF completes the stack - *prose + structure + **meaning** + tools* - because binding every field and relation to public vocabularies is precisely what lets **standard, schema-generated** tooling (JSON Schema, SHACL, SPARQL) validate and query the bundle instead of bespoke scripts.

> Scope: this skill owns **only** `.lokf/`. A plain, tooling-free sibling `okf/`
> would be owned by the separate **okf-librarian** skill. Every LOKF bundle is also a
> valid OKF bundle - keep the two consistent, but edit each through its own skill.
> If `.lokf/` doesn't exist yet, or the layout below is incomplete, run the

> semantic header (Rule 2), `knowledge/log.md`, the domain directories, plus

> skill assumes all of that is already in place.

## Layout

```
.lokf/
|-- knowledge/            # the bundle - one Markdown file per concept
|   |-- index.md          # bundle metadata (base_iri, context, versions) + TOC
|   |-- log.md            # change history (reserved name)
|   |-- services/  datasets/  references/
|   |-- playbooks/  glossary/  org/
|-- pyproject.toml        # declares the `lokf` toolkit dependency
|-- justfile              # lokf-install / lokf-validate / lokf-convert / lokf-serve
|-- scripts/              # (optional) knowledge-librarian.sh, the scheduled-agent wrapper (step 4)
```

The LOKF **format** is defined once in LinkML (`lokf.yaml`); the JSON Schema, JSON-LD context, SHACL shapes, and OWL ontology are **generated** from it and MUST NOT be hand-edited. This repo's `.lokf/` is a *consumer* of that published schema - you author concepts, the toolkit validates and projects them.

## Golden Rules (LOKF v0.2)

1. **It's [OKF first](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md).** One concept per file, path = concept ID, `type` is the only strictly required field, permissive consumption. Everything plain OKF requires (enforced by the okf-librarian skill, when the repo maintains an `okf/` sibling) still holds here.
2. **The bundle-root `index.md` carries the semantic header.** It declares the keys that lift the whole bundle into RDF (values shown are illustrative - the real ones are minted at scaffolding time):
   ```yaml
   lokf_version: "0.2"
   okf_version: "0.2"
   base_iri: https://acme.example/knowledge/
   context: https://w3id.org/lokf/context.jsonld
   title: Acme Platform Knowledge Bundle
   description: ...
   license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
   publisher: { type: Organization, id: https://acme.example/knowledge/org/platform-team, name: Acme Platform Team }
   ```
   `base_iri` + concept ID mints each concept's IRI (`@id`); `context` maps frontmatter keys to IRIs. Do not remove these or the bundle degrades to plain OKF.

   **Choosing `base_iri` - identifiers, not hyperlinks, but use a namespace you control.** A concept's `id` is a globally unique *name* that merely looks like a URL, so a 404 on it is *valid* - though Linked Data best practice ("Cool URIs") is that identifiers *should* eventually double as working links. The test for a good `base_iri` is **authority + future resolvability**:
   - **Never mint inside a URL space the project doesn't control** - e.g. `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/knowledge/...` or any third-party domain. The host owns that path space, so the IRIs can never be made to resolve, and they misattribute naming authority to the host.
   - **Prefer, in order:** (a) a namespace the project already publishes under - if its schemas/ontologies use a persistent-identifier namespace (w3id.org, purl.org, an owned domain), put the bundle there, e.g. `https://w3id.org/<org>/<project>/knowledge/`; (b) a new persistent-identifier registration (a w3id.org rule is a small PR to `perma-id/w3id.org`, redirectable later to rendered pages such as GitHub Pages); (c) a project-owned domain. Repo cues: schema `id`/namespace declarations, a docs `site_url`, a Pages deployment.
   - **Migrate early if the base is wrong.** Changing `base_iri` rewrites every concept `id` and breaks any external links to the old ones - cheap while the bundle is young, expensive later. When migrating: replace the namespace in `base_iri`, the publisher `id`, every concept `id`, and all typed-relation targets; leave `resource`/`distribution` URLs alone (real links, not minted identifiers); log the migration and rationale in `log.md`; re-run `just lokf-validate` and confirm the converted graph contains only the new namespace.
   - **If a human asks "these IDs don't resolve - is that a problem?"** Valid by design - but apply the test above: an uncontrolled namespace can never resolve and should be migrated; a controlled but not-yet-registered one just needs the pending registration noted, not the 404 treated as a defect.
3. **Use a class from the LOKF type vocabulary** (consumers tolerate unknowns as `lokf:Concept`): `Dataset`, `Table`, `Metric`, `Service`, `Playbook`, `Tutorial`, `Explanation`, `Policy`, `GlossaryTerm`, `Reference`, `Document`, `Person`, `Organization`, `AttestedComputation`. Type-specific fields: `Table/Dataset` -> `fields`, `distribution`; `Metric` -> `unit`, `formula`, `measures`; `Service` -> `endpoint`, `http_method`, `documentation`; `GlossaryTerm` -> `definition`, `abbreviation`. `distribution` and `fields` take structured objects, never plain strings or URLs: `Distribution` (`access_url`, `name?`, `description?`, `media_type?`) and `Field` (`name?`, `description?`, `datatype?`, `is_key?`, `unit?`, `constraints?`). Optional Diátaxis facet `genre` (`tutorial`|`how-to`|`reference`|`explanation`) tags how a concept's *prose* serves the reader - orthogonal to `type`; keep one mode per concept (split and link with `references`/`about` if it drifts). Choose the mode with the Diátaxis compass - is the reader *studying or working*, and *doing or thinking*? study+do -> `tutorial`, work+do -> `how-to`, work+think -> `reference`, study+think -> `explanation`. The quadrants are machine-readable: each `DiataxisMode` permissible value in the schema carries `diataxis_action_cognition` / `diataxis_acquisition_application` annotations, so derive the mapping from the schema rather than guessing.
4. **Prefer typed relationships over bare links** - this is LOKF's core upgrade. Each maps to a fixed RDF predicate; values are Concept IRIs (or IDs resolved against `base_iri`), all optional and multivalued:

   | field | predicate | meaning |
   |-------|-----------|---------|
   | `isPartOf` | `dcterms:isPartOf` | this is part of the target |
   | `hasPart` | `schema:hasPart` | the target is part of this |
   | `references` | `dcterms:references` | this refers to the target |
   | `dependsOn` | `dcterms:requires` | this depends on the target |
   | `derivedFrom` | `prov:wasDerivedFrom` | provenance |
   | `about` | `schema:about` | subject matter |
   | `sameAs` | `schema:sameAs` | same entity |
   | `relatedTo` | `dcterms:relation` | generic association |
   | `definedBy` | `rdfs:isDefinedBy` | formally defined by |
   | `source` | `dcterms:source` | sourced from the target |

   For predicates outside this set, use the generic `relations` list of reified objects (`predicate` from the `RelationType` vocab, e.g. `joinsWith`, plus `target`). Human-facing Markdown links in the body remain valid and encouraged alongside the typed fields.
5. **Core fields map to ontology terms:** `title`->`schema:name`, `description`->`schema:description`, `resource`->`schema:url`, `tags`->`schema:keywords`, `timestamp`->`schema:dateModified`, `body`->`schema:text` (the markdown after the frontmatter), plus optional `id`, `created`, `version`, `license`, `author`, `genre` (`schema:genre`, Rule 3), `citations`. Two JSON-LD aliases let plain OKF frontmatter behave as Linked Data: `type` -> `@type` (rdf:type, the concept's class) and `id` -> `@id` (the subject IRI). Two v0.1 fields are **superseded in v0.2** but still read as fallbacks: `timestamp` by `generated.at`, and `citations` by `sources` (Rule 6).
6. **Record trust, provenance & lifecycle (OKF v0.2 §5.4) where the source attests it.** These optional families make trust signals *queryable RDF* instead of loose YAML; their absence carries meaning (an unverified concept stays valid, never rejected). Never invent them - record only what the origin actually states.

   | family | field | shape -> RDF predicate | meaning |
   |--------|-------|------------------------|---------|
   | provenance | `generated` | `{ by, at }` -> `prov:wasGeneratedBy` | who/what produced the current content, and when. **Supersedes `timestamp`** - prefer it on new/changed concepts. |
   | trust | `verified` | list of `{ by, at }` -> `lokf:verified` | verification events; a bare `{ by, at }` mapping MUST be read as a one-element list. |
   | provenance | `sources` | list of Source -> `schema:isBasedOn` | materials the concept derives from: `resource` (REQUIRED), plus optional `id` (footnote/merge key), `title`, `author`, `usage_count`, `last_modified`. Supersedes `citations`. |
   | usage | `usage_window` | `{ from, to }` (dates) -> `lokf:usageWindow` | window framing `usage_count` signals; sibling of `sources` (a Source entry MAY override). |
   | lifecycle | `status` | `draft`\|`stable`\|`deprecated` -> `schema:creativeWorkStatus` | absent ⇒ stable. |
   | lifecycle | `stale_after` | date -> `schema:expires` | stale when `today >= stale_after`. |

   **Actors** (`generated.by`, `verified[].by`, `sources[].author`) are plain OKF §7 literal strings - `<producer>/<version>`, `human:<id>`, `process:<id>` - carried verbatim, never coerced to IRIs. **Trust tiers derive from them, never stored:** no `verified` ⇒ *unverified*; only non-human actors ⇒ *machine-confirmed*; any `human:` actor ⇒ *human-reviewed*.

   **AttestedComputation** (`type: AttestedComputation`; OKF's spaced `Attested Computation` normalizes to this) carries an immutable, sanctioned recipe - semantically a `prov:Plan`: `runtime` (REQUIRED, e.g. `bigquery`|`postgres`|`dbt`|`python`), `parameters` (each `{ name, type, required }` where `type` is drawn from `ParameterType`), `computation` (optional file path; omit it and the body's `# Computation` fenced block IS the recipe), `executor` (`{ resource, receipt }`), `attester` (`{ resource }`).
7. **Stay permissive.** Missing optional fields, unknown `type`, unknown keys, and broken cross-links MUST NOT cause rejection.

## 1. Scrape & build

Derive concepts from the host repository (or, as an edge case, any directory tree) - never invent facts. **The bundle itself is the scrape map**: every concept records where it came from (`resource`, `derivedFrom`, `source`), and the map of knowledge sources is itself a reviewed concept. Steady-state runs are deterministic re-verification against that recorded provenance, not fresh discovery.

### Bootstrap discovery - first run, or whenever the bundle has no real concepts

Sweep the repository with generic heuristics and map what you find to LOKF classes:

| Look at | Typical finds | Class |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| manifests (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, ...), entry points, `Dockerfile`/compose files, CI config | APIs, CLIs, UIs, workers, databases | `Service` |
| data and schema files (CSV/YAML/JSON/SQL), fixtures, migrations | datasets, tables | `Dataset` / `Table` (use `fields`, `distribution`) |
| external standards, specs, and ontologies the code or data encodes | upstream authorities | `Reference` (wire `derivedFrom` from the encoding `Dataset`) |
| README and docs guides - split by reader need (Diátaxis) | getting-started lessons / task recipes / austere API-or-schema descriptions / why-and-context discussions | `Tutorial` (learning) / `Playbook` (how-to) / `Reference`, `Dataset`, `Table` (reference) / `Explanation` (understanding); set `genre` to match |
| domain terms recurring across code, data, and docs | vocabulary | `GlossaryTerm` |
| ownership files (`CODEOWNERS`, manifest authors), publishers named inside data files | owners, publishers | `Organization` / `Person` - add only when another concept links to them (e.g. `Reference` -> `Organization` via `source`) |

Record the resulting map as a concept: **`playbooks/knowledge-sources.md`** (`type: Playbook`), listing each knowledge source (repo path or external URL), the class(es) it yields, and how to re-check it. Discovery output thereby lives in the bundle, versioned and human-reviewed like every other concept - not in this skill.

### Steady-state refresh - every later run

1. **Re-verify provenance.** For each existing concept, follow its `resource`/`derivedFrom`/`source` back to the origin: does it still exist, are the facts still true, do relations still point the right way? Fix drift - including **deleting** concepts whose source no longer exists (remove their index bullets and log the removal).
2. **Re-walk `playbooks/knowledge-sources.md`.** Sources listed there may have grown new assets since the last run.
3. **Sweep for orphans.** Repository files or directories that no concept and no source-map entry accounts for are gap candidates: add a concept, extend the source map, or consciously leave them out.
4. **Update the source map** whenever the repository's knowledge geography changes - it must stay as accurate as the concepts it feeds.
5. **Check sidecar tooling versions.** Run `uv pip index versions lokf 2>&1 | head -3` and compare the latest PyPI release against the `>=` floor in `.lokf/pyproject.toml`. For a **minor/patch** bump: update the floor, run `uv sync`, re-run `just lokf-validate`. For a **major** bump or changelog-noted breaking change: **ask the human first** - concept frontmatter may need updates. Never bump `linkml` independently; let `lokf`'s resolver govern it. If PyPI is unreachable, skip and note it in the handoff.

Then add the semantic layer: pick the right class, set `id`, and wire typed relationships instead of guessing. Give every concept derived from the repository a `resource` (and `derivedFrom`/`source` where provenance is external) so the next refresh can re-verify it. The example below is **fictional** - an imaginary "Acme Platform" repo, not a concept of any real project; never copy its values, mint IRIs from the bundle's real `base_iri`:

```markdown
---
type: Service
id: https://acme.example/knowledge/services/orders-api
title: Orders API
description: REST API serving order data to the CLI and web UI.
endpoint: https://api.acme.example/orders

# Overview

The **Orders API** generates its endpoints from `services/orders/openapi.yaml` and serves the order data consumed by the CLI and web UI...
```

On every concept you create or materially change, record provenance with `generated: { by: <OKF §7 actor>, at: <ISO 8601 UTC datetime> }` (`prov:wasGeneratedBy`) - e.g. `at: "2026-08-05T00:00:00Z"`, `by: process:lokf-librarian`. This supersedes the v0.1 `timestamp` (`schema:dateModified`), which consumers still read as a fallback; keep `timestamp` only on v0.1 concepts you are not otherwise touching. Never bump `generated`/`timestamp` on untouched concepts, or the diff fills with churn. Update the nearest `index.md` (bullet + `description`) and prepend a dated entry to `log.md` (newest first, ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date header - log dates are date-only, concept timestamps are datetime+Z). `log.md` records **knowledge changes only** - concepts added/changed/removed, or the source map updated. If a run changes nothing in the bundle, write no log entry; never log administrative events ("librarian ran, no changes detected") - they do not represent a knowledge change.

## 2. Audit (correctness, gaps, bugs)

Use the toolkit - it gives you two independent, generated validators. From
`.lokf/`:

```bash
just lokf-install          # uv sync  (first time)
just lokf-validate         # JSON Schema on frontmatter + assembled bundle
just lokf-convert          # project to Turtle/RDF; eyeball the triples
just lokf-serve            # SPARQL endpoint + live graph explorer (optional)
```

`lokf validate` catches frontmatter/bundle-shape errors; the generated SHACL shapes catch cardinality/datatype/range violations on the projected graph. Beyond mechanical validity, audit for:

- **Correctness** - class matches the asset; typed relations point the right way (`isPartOf` vs `hasPart`, `dependsOn` vs `derivedFrom`); `id`/`base_iri` mint the expected IRIs and the namespace passes Rule 2's authority test (not inside a URL space the project doesn't control); `endpoint`/`resource` still resolve.
- **Gaps** - new code/data files with no concept; untyped body links that should be typed relations; missing `id` on concepts other bundles link to; classes left as generic `lokf:Concept` that have a proper vocabulary type; concepts whose provenance/trust is knowable but unrecorded (missing `generated`, `sources`, or a `status`/`stale_after` on content that has clearly gone `deprecated` or stale).
- **Bugs** - malformed YAML, invalid enum/datatype (fails JSON Schema or SHACL), relation targets that resolve to nothing *intended*, missing `base_iri`/`context` in the root `index.md`, `pyproject.toml` `lokf` constraint missing a `>=` floor or behind the latest release (see step 5).

Report findings as a checklist; fix mechanical issues directly and re-run `just lokf-validate`.

## 3. Hand off for human maintainer review

Open a PR scoped to `.lokf/` with a summary, the `lokf validate` (and, when relevant, SHACL/convert) output, and citations for every claim whose authority lives outside the repository - the standards, ontologies, and upstream systems the bundle's `Reference` concepts point at. A human maintainer verifies against the canonical source and approves before merge. Once `.github/workflows/knowledge-validate.yaml` exists (see section 4), it runs `uv run lokf validate knowledge` on every `.lokf/**` PR as the automated gate; until then, paste the local `just lokf-validate` output into the PR.

## 4. Scheduled librarian task (Karpathy rule)

Keep the graph continuously accurate rather than rewriting it in bursts. Three
pieces automate this rebuild loop - the **lokf-scaffolding** skill's Step 5
scaffolds them; this section is their operating manual:

**`.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml`** - the rebuild workflow. Runs weekly (Mondays, 05:00 UTC) and on demand (`workflow_dispatch`). Each run: checks out full history -> sets up `uv` -> installs the `lokf` sidecar -> runs the agent -> validates -> diffs `.lokf/knowledge/` (only the bundle, so tool artifacts never trigger a PR) -> if anything changed, commits to a fresh `knowledge-librarian/<date>-<run_id>` branch and opens a review PR via `github-script`. Guardrails: it holds only `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write`, never pushes to the default branch, never auto-merges, and opens no PR when nothing changed. A no-change run must leave the bundle byte-for-byte untouched, including `log.md` (section 1's log policy).

**`.lokf/scripts/knowledge-librarian.sh`** - the agent wrapper the workflow invokes. Point the `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_CMD` repository variable at `bash .lokf/scripts/knowledge-librarian.sh` and set `AGENT_CLI` to your non-interactive agent command. The script selects the lokf-librarian skill, builds a prompt telling the agent to follow it and re-scrape the repo, then calls `AGENT_CLI`. Its contract: it edits **only** files under `.lokf/knowledge/` and performs no git/PR operations - the workflow owns branch/commit/PR. If `KNOWLEDGE_LIBRARIAN_CMD` is unset, the workflow's agent step is a safe no-op, so the workflow is harmless until you wire the agent up.

**`.github/workflows/knowledge-validate.yaml`** - the gate. Its `validate` job runs `uv run lokf validate knowledge` on the librarian PR (and on every `.lokf/**` PR and its own weekly schedule); keep it green. The bar: the projected RDF graph should always describe the repository as it is *today*.
