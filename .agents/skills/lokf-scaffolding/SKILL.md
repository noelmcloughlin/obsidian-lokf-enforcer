description: 'Scaffold a `.lokf/` LOKF knowledge-bundle sidecar (tooling, docs, dummy skeleton) into the repository this skill sits in, from bundled templates. Use when: a repo has no `.lokf/` yet and someone asks to add, scaffold, or bootstrap a LOKF/lokf sidecar or machine-readable, SPARQL-queryable knowledge; or to repair a missing/broken scaffolding file. Not for authoring or maintaining concepts - that is the lokf-librarian skill, which this one hands off to when done.'

# LOKF Scaffolding

Create a fresh **`.lokf/` sidecar** - a machine-readable, SPARQL-queryable [LOKF](https://lokf.nolan-nichols.com/) knowledge bundle - inside the repository this skill is invoked from: directory, tooling, docs, and a small
**dummy** skeleton, then hand off to **lokf-librarian** to fill it with real knowledge. Every file is copied from `templates/` (paths below are relative to this skill's directory), never retyped.

> Sources: lokf.nolan-nichols.com is the canonical site for what LOKF *means*
> (spec, Golden Rules). The tooling this skill installs comes from the
> [`lokf` PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/lokf/); with no Python, the
> raw schema <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicholsn/lokf/main/lokf.yaml>
> is the fallback (Step 4). Cite each for its own role in generated docs.

> Model: a small/mid-tier model is enough here - Step 1 copies templates and
> substitutes placeholders; Step 0 is structured file lookup. Mistakes are
> caught by Step 3's grep and Step 6's human sign-off. **lokf-librarian** is
> the opposite case: keep it on the calling agent's normal model.

## Scope

- **This skill** - run **once** to create `.lokf/`, or to **repair** a missing/broken scaffolding file (anything in the Step 1/5 tables). Never authors real concepts.
- **lokf-librarian** - run **often** to scrape the repo and create, maintain, and audit the actual concepts and typed relations.

> Guardrails: if `.lokf/` exists and is healthy, use lokf-librarian instead.
> When repairing, (re)write only the missing/broken file - including a missing
> `llms.txt`/README pointer on an older bundle; **never overwrite concept
> files**. Non-git, non-GitHub, or non-POSIX host: see
> [references/portability.md](references/portability.md).

## Step 0 - Gather the host project's facts

Resolve every placeholder from real project sources before writing anything; never leave a `<...>` token or dummy value behind.

| Placeholder | Meaning | Where to find it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<PROJ_NAME>` | Human-readable project name | manifest `name` (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, ...), root `README.md` title, service catalog, or repo name |
| `<PROJ_DESC>` | One-sentence description | manifest `description`, README intro, or service catalog |
| `<PROJ_SLUG>` | lowercase-hyphenated slug | derive from `<PROJ_NAME>` (`Acme Platform` -> `acme-platform`) |
| `<BASE_IRI>` | Bundle base IRI, **must end with `/`** | (1) a persistent-identifier namespace the project already publishes under (w3id.org, purl.org, owned domain) + `/knowledge/`; (2) a stable URL the project controls (docs `site_url`, Pages, service catalog) + `/knowledge/`; (3) else `https://<PROJ_SLUG>.example/knowledge/`, flagged for review. **Never** the code-host repo URL (`https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/...`) - that path space isn't the project's, so the IDs could never resolve |
| `<OWNER_NAME>` | Owning team/org display name | `CODEOWNERS`, manifest authors, service catalog, or README |
| `<OWNER_SLUG>` | lowercase-hyphenated owner slug | derive from `<OWNER_NAME>` |
| `<TODAY>` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | system clock (for `log.md`) |

`<BASE_IRI>` is load-bearing: `base_iri` + concept path mints each concept's `@id`. It need not resolve today, but must be stable and in a namespace the project controls (lokf-librarian Rule 2 has the authority test and migration steps). A plain directory tree with no manifest/CODEOWNERS/repo: use the directory name, any document in the tree, and the `.example` fallback - and flag every guess in Step 6.

**Tracked or gitignored - decide now.** Check whether the root `.gitignore` already excludes `.lokf/` (ask if unclear). Committing `.lokf/` is the default four skills assume; gitignoring it is equally valid (personal bundle, or a policy against committing agent-authored content) but changes three things: still create every file (the bundle is filesystem-based either way); skip the commit in Step 4 and all of Step 5; say so in the Step 6 handoff. This is unrelated to `.lokf/.gitignore` below, which only excludes tool build noise.

> Repo hygiene note: if the host repo installs AI skills locally, the generated runtime directories `.agents/`, `.claude/`, and the lockfile `skills-lock.json` are not source content and should be excluded from the root `.gitignore` rather than committed as project changes.

## Step 1 - Create the skeleton and copy the templates

Copy each template to its destination, then substitute the placeholders it lists. Only these placeholders exist; `templates/gitignore` is written as
`.lokf/.gitignore`.

| Template | Destination | Placeholders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `templates/pyproject.toml` | `.lokf/pyproject.toml` | PROJ_NAME, PROJ_SLUG |
| `templates/gitignore` | `.lokf/.gitignore` | - |
| `templates/justfile` | `.lokf/justfile` | PROJ_NAME |
| `templates/README.md` | `.lokf/README.md` | PROJ_NAME |
| `templates/knowledge/index.md` | `.lokf/knowledge/index.md` (semantic header + TOC, reserved) | PROJ_NAME, PROJ_DESC, BASE_IRI, OWNER_NAME, OWNER_SLUG |
| `templates/knowledge/log.md` | `.lokf/knowledge/log.md` (reserved) | PROJ_NAME, TODAY |
| `templates/knowledge/services/index.md` | `.lokf/knowledge/services/index.md` | - |
| `templates/knowledge/services/example-service-a.md`, `-b.md` | same paths under `.lokf/` (DUMMY - lokf-librarian replaces) | PROJ_NAME, PROJ_SLUG, BASE_IRI |
| `templates/queries.http` *(optional, default on)* | `.lokf/queries.http` | PROJ_NAME |

```bash
mkdir -p .lokf/knowledge/services
# ...copy the rows above, then e.g.:
grep -rl -e '<PROJ_' -e '<BASE_IRI>' -e '<OWNER_' -e '<TODAY>' .lokf \
  | xargs sed -i -e "s|<PROJ_NAME>|$PROJ_NAME|g" -e "s|<PROJ_DESC>|$PROJ_DESC|g" \
      -e "s|<PROJ_SLUG>|$PROJ_SLUG|g" -e "s|<BASE_IRI>|$BASE_IRI|g" \
      -e "s|<OWNER_NAME>|$OWNER_NAME|g" -e "s|<OWNER_SLUG>|$OWNER_SLUG|g" -e "s|<TODAY>|$TODAY|g"
```

(If a value contains `|`, substitute with your editor instead of sed.)

## Step 2 - Point agents at the bundle (optional, root-level)

Two additions at the **repo root**, outside `.lokf/`. Add only, never overwrite, and check for an existing pointer first. Both templates are worded
to stay true **whether or not `.lokf/` exists later**, so nothing ever needs cleaning up if the bundle is removed - keep that self-qualifying phrasing.

- **`llms.txt`** - copy `templates/llms.txt` (PROJ_NAME, PROJ_DESC) if absent. If it exists, leave it intact and append only the `## Agent context`
  section, and only if the file doesn't already mention `.lokf/`.
- **README pointer** - if `README.md` exists and doesn't already link to `.lokf/knowledge/` anywhere (check the path, not a heading string), insert
  `templates/readme-for-ai-agents.md` after the intro, before the first `##`. It is a one-paragraph blockquote aside, not a section: agents read the top of a README, a human skims past an aside, and the trust-weighing detail lives in `llms.txt` rather than being repeated here. Don't invent a README on a host that has none.

## Step 3 - Verify the skeleton

Placeholder tokens only - the files legitimately contain other angle brackets:

```bash
grep -rn -e '<PROJ_' -e '<BASE_IRI>' -e '<OWNER_' -e '<TODAY>' .lokf/ llms.txt
```

Zero hits means fully resolved. Leave the `example-service-*.md` dummies as dummies (or delete them for an empty bundle) - don't enumerate real services.

## Step 4 - Validate the skeleton

```bash
cd .lokf && just lokf-install && just lokf-validate   # uv sync; schema-valid
```

No `uv`/`lokf`? There's no substitute for the generated JSON Schema/SHACL checks, but fetch the raw schema (Sources note) and manually cross-check the
`Service` class and the slots you used - a structural sanity check, not a validation run. Report in Step 6 whether validation ran, ran as this manual
fallback, or was skipped. Never log this in `knowledge/log.md` (knowledge changes only). Fix findings, then commit - unless `.lokf/` is gitignored
(Step 0), in which case there is nothing to commit.

## Step 5 - Scaffold the automation (optional)

**Skip entirely if `.lokf/` is gitignored** - both workflows need the bundle on a remote branch, and the librarian loop's `git status --porcelain` check
silently reports "no changes" for an ignored path forever. GitHub-only; other hosts: copy just the wrapper and schedule it with cron/CI (see
[references/portability.md](references/portability.md)). No placeholders.

| Template | Destination |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/github/knowledge-validate.yaml` | `.github/workflows/knowledge-validate.yaml` |
| `templates/github/knowledge-librarian.yaml` | `.github/workflows/knowledge-librarian.yaml` |
| `templates/scripts/knowledge-librarian.sh` | `.lokf/scripts/knowledge-librarian.sh` (`chmod +x`) |

The wrapper looks for `lokf-librarian/SKILL.md` under `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, then bare `skills/` (a repo that
publishes the skills it also uses) - if this repo uses another directory, add it to the script's `candidate` list now, and run the script once to confirm:
a mismatch otherwise fails at scheduled-run time, not scaffold time. What each file does, the repo variables to wire, and the runner/SHA-pin notes:
[references/automation.md](references/automation.md).

## Step 6 - Hand off to lokf-librarian

Scaffolding ends here; lokf-librarian's first run is a **bootstrap discovery** pass that records the repo's knowledge sources as
`playbooks/knowledge-sources.md`; the librarian in turn hands off to **lokf-curator**, where a person confirms what it derived; and
**lokf-docent** answers readers from the bundle, recording what it lacked for the librarian's next run - so all four skills should be installed. In the
handoff, tell the user:

- which Step 0 values were **guessed** rather than found (a fallback `<BASE_IRI>` above all - it mints every `@id`, so it needs sign-off);
- whether Step 4 validation ran, ran as the manual fallback, or was skipped;
- which optional pieces (`queries.http`, Step 2 pointers, Step 5 automation) were added, appended to, or left alone because they already existed;
- whether `.lokf/` is **git-tracked or gitignored** - this decides whether lokf-librarian's PR-based review and any Step 5 automation apply at all.
